- 👋 Hi, I’m Faz,
- 🎹 I produce music for a living and write basic programs both for fun and also to help speed up my work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lua and Python.
- ⌨️ I'm mostly writing Lua scripts for Reaper at the moment... if I write anything that I think others could use... I'll upload it here.

- I hope you find something here that helps you.
